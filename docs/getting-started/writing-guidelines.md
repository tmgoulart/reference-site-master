# {{ page.title }}

When editing existing, or writing new documentation, please try to adhere to the
following guidelines.

- Use `.md` as the file extension and write content in markdown-syntax when
  possible.
- Add HTML only when required, but still continue to use .md file to ensure the
  layouts are used and Edit Source button works.
- Ideal line width is 80 characters or less. Up to 120 characters still work OK
on github, but making proof-reading and editing text harder, ok for embedded
HTML
- Do not use TAB and other characters that invalidates JSON formatted content.
- Use a spell checker.
- Observe the usage of title case in section and page titles.
- Use consistent naming in text e.g. always OneOps and not oneops, SSH and not
  ssh, URL and not url.

For image inclusion there are some specific requests:

- Do not add too many images.
- Keep the image size suitable for the web site.
- Images should concentrate on the relevant content.
- PNG format is preferred.

In terms of specific syntax and more, please consult our
[Markdown Guidelines](./markdown-guidelines.html)

# Upgrades

WMT is constantly maintained and improved. These changes can be adopted by WMT
based sites easily:

- Ask for a release zip or create one up yourself by running `./makeRelease.sh`
  in a current clone of this project
- Unzip the archive into your project
- Review the [changelog](./changelog.html) based on the date range from the
  original and the new date in `wmt-release-id.txt`
- Adapt your configuration and other files based on the changelog review
